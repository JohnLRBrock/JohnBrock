#### Who I am:
I have a BA in psychology which means I can do whatever I want as long as it's not psychology. I've always loved puzzles. When I find a good one I drop everything until it's solved; that's why people don't trust me with babies anymore. I get excited for new experiences, enjoy exploration, and constantly seek self improvement. I'm curious, eager to learn, and always put my absolute best work into anything I do.

#### How I got here:

I started with Python. I built basic programs, with little thought to style or maintainability. I discovered I loved solving problems on Project Euler and used it to hone my skills. I wanted to get serious about programming and learn a “serious” language so I picked up C++. Then I took CS50X on edX to be more well rounded and realized I needed to look for a path to a career. A friend showed me The Odin Project and I began to learn web development through it; I’ve learned Ruby, Rails, SQL, test driven development, coding style, and the importance of best practices.
