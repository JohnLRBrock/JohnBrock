  <p>John Brock received his degree in Psychology from the University of South Florida and he honestly didn't think anyone would read this. He learned web development through <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/courses">The Odin Project</a> and thinks that having to write about himself in the third person is <i>weird</i>. As a pragmatic developer he is always asking himself "how can I do better?" and "why did someone click on his <i>about the author</i> page?" John Brock once linked a CSS page to an HTML page in one go, so he's pretty much an expert.</p>
