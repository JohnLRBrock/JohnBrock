The topic of the fourth section of the style guide is **arrays** which are handy objects for containing collections of ordered data. To learn the basics of arrays you can read this guide from [w3schools][array basics] and to dive deeper you can read the documentation from [mozilla][array documentation].

## Section 4: Arrays
### [4.1][4.1]: Use the literal syntax for array creation. eslint: [no-array-constructor][no-array-constructor]
There are two main ways of creating arrays. Just like with object construction, using literals is faster and less prone to errors and is therefore the preferred method for creating arrays.
```javascript
// using new, bad
const items = new Array();

// using a literal, good
const items = [];
```
### [4.2][4.2]: Use `Array#push` instead of direct assignment to add items to an array.
Using push is clearer and more succinct.
```javascript
const someStack = [];

// bad
someStack[someStack.length] = 'abracadabra';

// good
someStack.push('abracadabra');
```
### [4.3][4.3]: Use array spreads ... to copy arrays.
Spreads are useful ways to copy many objects in JavaScript. For more information read the reference doc from [Mozilla][spread operator documentation]. In this case we use it because is is clearer and more succinct than the alternative.
```javascript
// bad
const len = items.length;
const itemsCopy = [];
let i;

for (i = 0; i < len; i += 1) {
  itemsCopy[i] = items[i];
}

// good
const itemsCopy = [...items];
```
### [4.4][4.4]: To convert an array-like object to an array, use [`Array.from`][array from].
Once again, the preferred method is more expressive and easier to write.
```javascript
const foo = document.querySelectorAll('.foo');
const nodes = Array.from(foo);
```
### [4.5][4.5]: Use return statements in array method callbacks. Itâ€™s ok to omit the return if the function body consists of a single statement returning an expression without side effects, following [8.2][8.2]. eslint: [array-callback-return][array-callback-return]
There are certain methods that execute a block of code on each item in an array (Ex. reduce, map, filter, etc.). That block of code is referred to as a callback. If the callback is more than one line long, use a return statement. Otherwise skip it.
```javascript
// good
[1, 2, 3].map((x) => {
  const y = x + 1;
  return x * y;
});

// good
[1, 2, 3].map(x => x + 1);

// bad
const flat = {};
[[0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5]].reduce((memo, item, index) => {
  const flatten = memo.concat(item);
  flat[index] = flatten;
});

// good
const flat = {};
[[0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5]].reduce((memo, item, index) => {
  const flatten = memo.concat(item);
  flat[index] = flatten;
  return flatten;
});

// bad
inbox.filter((msg) => {
  const { subject, author } = msg;
  if (subject === 'Mockingbird') {
    return author === 'Harper Lee';
  } else {
    return false;
  }
});

// good
inbox.filter((msg) => {
  const { subject, author } = msg;
  if (subject === 'Mockingbird') {
    return author === 'Harper Lee';
  }

  return false;
});
```

### [4.6][4.6]: Use line breaks after open and before close array brackets if an array has multiple lines
This simply makes the array more readable.
```javascript
// bad
const arr = [
  [0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5],
];

const objectInArray = [{
  id: 1,
}, {
  id: 2,
}];

const numberInArray = [
  1, 2,
];

// good
const arr = [[0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5]];

const objectInArray = [
  {
    id: 1,
  },
  {
    id: 2,
  },
];

const numberInArray = [
  1,
  2,
];
```

### Why Should I Care?
Arrays are one of the simplest, most intuitive, and most useful tools used by JavaScript programmers to create **data structures**. They are an essential tool for every programmer and if you're going to do work in JavaScript you need to know how to make and work with them.

### Next up: Destructuring
Next Saturday I'll explain what destructuring is and why it's useful.
