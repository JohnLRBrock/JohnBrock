When hurricane Irma rolled through my house lost water, power, and internet. I should have been prepared and worked some posts ahead of time but in preparing for the storm updating this blog slipped my mind. My apologies. Although power and water has been restored to my house, the internet is still down which will impede my work but I promise to get caught back up again. I'm also going to get a buffer built so that I'll be prepared in case of another emergency.

Thank you all for your patience. I'll have the posts up soonâ„¢.
