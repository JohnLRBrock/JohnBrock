I lost water, power, and internet when hurricane Irma hit. In hindsight I should have been prepared with blog posts ahead of time but this blog slipped my mind in the whirlwind of preparations I had to do. My apologies. Although power and water has been restored to my house, the internet is still down which will impede my work but I promise to get caught back up again. I'm also going to get a buffer built so that I'll be prepared in case of another emergency.

Thank you all for your patience. I'll have the posts up soonâ„¢.
