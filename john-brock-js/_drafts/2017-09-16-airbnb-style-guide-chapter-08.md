title: "ELI50: Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide Section 8: Arrow Functions"

[Airbnb][airbnb], the online marketplace for housing rentals, has a high quality and 'mostly reasonable' style guide for JavaScript, a programming language that adds dynamic behaviors to web browsers. Some of the topics in the guide are a bit advanced for beginners. This "Explain Like I'm 50" (ELI50) series will act as a plain English companion-guide to the [Airbnb style guide][style guide], because good design principles shouldn't be out of anyone's reach.

This week will cover a new feature to ES6, **arrow functions** `() => {}`. This is JavaScript's version of a **lambda function**. These are small, nameless functions that can be passed as an argument. They are more terse than creating an anonymous function with `function() {}` but there's more to arrow functions than that!
