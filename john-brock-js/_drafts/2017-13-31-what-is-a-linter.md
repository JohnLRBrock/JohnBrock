Each programmer has their own style, conscious or otherwise. Some people are verbose, others are terse, and some are slapdash. Style covers everything from usage of whitespace, to what you name variables, to how common actions are performed. Often companies will put together a list of guidelines for style, aptly called a **style guide**. One of the most popular style guides for JavaScript is [Airbnb's][airbnb styleguide]. Many of the topics in the guide are advanced for beginners and with so many rules it can be challenging to remember them all.
