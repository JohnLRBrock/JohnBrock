### Who I am:
I have a BA in psychology which means I can do whatever I want as long as it's not psychology. I've always loved puzzles. When I find a good one I drop everything until it's solved; that's why people don't trust me with babies anymore. I get excited for new experiences, enjoy exploration, and constantly seek self improvement. I'm curious, eager to learn, and always put my absolute best work into anything I do.
<br>
<br>
### How I got here:

I started with Python. I built basic programs, with little thought to style or maintainability. I discovered I loved solving problems on Project Euler and used it to hone my skills. I wanted to get serious about programming and learn a “serious” language so I picked up C++. Then I took CS50X on edX to be more well rounded and realized I needed to look for a path to a career. A friend showed me The Odin Project and I began to learn web development through it; I’ve learned Ruby, Rails, SQL, test driven development, coding style, and the importance of best practices.

### My projects:

<br>
#### [Book Overload](https://book-overload.herokuapp.com/) - [Github Repo](https://github.com/Khanthulhu/book-overload)
This app solves that problem by emailing the user a random set of books from their to-read shelf. Users are introduced to books that they were interested in all over again and in more manageable quantities.

This app uses a Rails backend, Nokogiri and open URI to contact the goodreads api, Activejobs with the suckerpunch backend and a mutex to make sure only one request is made at a time, and ActionMailer with sendgrid to send emails.

<br>
#### [The Dog Park](https://the-dog-park.herokuapp.com/) - [Github Repo](https://github.com/Khanthulhu/The-Dog-Park)

The world's first social network for dogs. The Dog Park is a facebook clone made for the Ruby on Rails final project at the Odin Project.

Features include friendships, posts, comments, likes, and more. The app has a Rails back end, postgresql database, authentication system with devise, authentication through facebook using omniauth, and is hosted on Heroku.

<br>
#### [Snake](https://khanthulhu.github.io/snakeGame/) - [Github Repo](https://github.com/Khanthulhu/snakeGame)

An implementation of the game Snake done completely in JavaScript to get a stronger understanding of JQuery and JavaScript programs.
