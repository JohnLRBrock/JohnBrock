<!-- What do I want to say with this? -->
<!-- The GOP is creating a new wedge issue that I predict will come into play in 2018 election -->

<!-- The GOP will hope that this will be an issue that will weaken Democrat's support in red areas -->

Today, the 26th, Trump announced plans to ban transgender people from serving in the United States military. He sites medical costs and distractions as the predominant reason but a Trump administration official paints a different picture.

> "This forces Democrats in Rust Belt states like Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin, to take complete ownership of this issue. How will the blue collar voters in these states respond when senators up for re-election in 2018 like Debbie Stabenow are forced to make their opposition to this a key plank of their campaigns?"

This quote illustrates that one of the intended effects of this policy is to whip the Democrats into a flurry and then use the resultant conservative push back to strengthen their support in those areas.

The insidiousness of this plan is that if this becomes a major issue in the 2018 elections then Democrats can't simply ignore an attack on transgender people's freedom to protect and serve their country.
