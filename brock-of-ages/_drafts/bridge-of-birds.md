[Bridge of Birds][amazon link] by Barry Hughart is a difficult book to describe. It's a genre defying mash-up of Doctor Who, Rick and Morty, fantasy, and Chinese fairy tales. The book beautifully written, hilarious, witty, endearing, and has bottomless charm.

Although the book starts slow, it's short, at less than 300 pages, and once the plot gets moving you'll fall in love with the world and characters. It's easily the best novel I've read all year. If you're a lover of stories, don't miss out on Bridge of Birds. 5/5.
