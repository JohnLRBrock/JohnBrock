## From Inception to Launch

In the previous article, {{ link_to "How to Make a Web App: Inception" }}, I discussed how to come up with ideas and determine if they are worth pursuing or not. Once you have an idea you have to plan how to execute it.

When planning out your app you need to perform a needs assessment, decide on the tools that you'll use, create a site map, and build a wireframe.

## Needs Assessment

you can't do anything until a **needs assessment** is created. A needs assessment is determininnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnng the difference between what you have now and what you need for thte app to be completed.
