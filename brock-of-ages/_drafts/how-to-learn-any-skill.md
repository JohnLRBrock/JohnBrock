Deliberate practice
  Practice vs deliberate practice
  Practice the basics


The first step to learning a skill is to try. No one learns to walk without taking the first step. But practicing isn't enough to become great. You need to practice **deliberately**.

### What does it mean to practice deliberately?

Deliberate practice means practicing with the intent of getting better. 
* Take an inventory of all the mini skills that make up the main skill
* Decide how your going to practice them
* Practice with the intent of getting better
* Bonus points if you can measure your performance
* Practice doesn't make perfect. Perfect practice makes perfect.
