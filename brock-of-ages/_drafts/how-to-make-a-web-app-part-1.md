## From Inception to Launch

This series will chronicle my development of a web app, from inception to launch, and describe my process along the way covering, planning, design, development, and launch.

In this article I'll show how I come up with ideas for apps, figure out which ideas are worth pursuing, and decide what tools to use to build them.

## Who is this for?
This series is for the person who has made a few websites but doesn't know where to go from there. We'll wear many hats, doing work in everything from back-end, to front-end, to design. I'll be showing you tools, best practices, and design patterns that help break down complex problems, and make the build process more manageable.

## Where do great ideas come from?
Before you can do anything else, you need an idea. It's not enough to just say 'Come up with an app that solves a problem.' A great idea requires creativity, insight, and sometimes a little luck. But, because it requires creativity, focusing on a problem counter-intuitively makes it harder to come up with a solution. The key is to let your mind wander to wherever it wants to go. It often helps doing another activity at the same time which doesn't require focus, like taking a walk. Inspiration can strike at any time so it's important to have something to write your ideas down on at all times like a notepad or a phone.

The problem that I'm looking to solve is that of recommendations from friends. I have a tight group of friends and when we find something that we love, we share it with each other. News, books, music, articles, movies, shows, etc. The problem is, we're all busy people and by the time we are free to take the recommendation we might not remember what it was. To solve this problem I'm going to make a To-Do list app that let's other people make items for you.

Once you come up with an idea you need to do some research and answer three important questions.
## Three important questions:
### Does it already exist?

There is value in making a clone. For instance, if you're building a portfolio, adding copies of websites everyone knows will help your reader immediately understand what they're supposed to be. Other websites can also be an inspiration to you and help you come up with challenges that push you further. That being said, I prefer making original apps over clones of things that already exist. Not only is it more gratifying, but I'm creating a solution to a problem that hasn't been solved yet.

So, does my app exist already? Sort of. There are loads of To-Do lists out there and some of them even specialize in collaboration, but none of them are perfect fits for what I'm looking for.

### Is it feasible?

Once we've determined that the app I want to make doesn't exist we have to figure out if it's feasible to make. People come up with ideas all the time that will be "revolutionary" or "kill an industry" and will probably end up going no where. Often times this is because the person didn't understand the kind of challenges that are in the way. Often times the Next Big Thing isn't being made because of some advancement in technology or innovation that has finally made it feasible. You need to make sure that your app can be made so that you don't end up halfway through it and have to throw everything out because you didn't realize that what you thought would be easy was actually intractable. There are a seemingly uncountable number of these ideas in the realm of machine learning. People think of it like some kind of magic tool that will solve all their problems but don't understand what it takes to implement.

Is my app feasible? Heck yeah it is. Many people have solved the problems that this app is going to have and I can build upon those solutions. It won't require any kind of advanced technologies and it should be easy to scale.

### Would other people use it?

The final question is whether or not people will use it. The answer to this question doesn't necessarily need to be yes for the app to have worth. The app could be a good portfolio piece, teach you a new skill, or be something that only you use. I have an app that sends the user random books from their Goodreads To-Read shelf. No one uses it, but I still love that app because it still solves my problem. The thing with that app, though, is that it's not very scalable because of API restrictions so I don't mind that no one uses the app. Sometimes, though, your app only works with a large user base. What will you do with your machine learning app that never gets the user base you need to train it? Once you have a pessimistic guess for how large your audience will be, you have to decide if building it will be worth it for you. You have to weight the cost of production versus the potential benefits you'll make.

Will people use my app? Maybe. I'm mostly interested in if my friends will use it so I polled my audience before I invested to much else in the production of the app. The to-do app market is packed with other contenders, so it's not likely that my little app will go viral but it can still make my life easier so it's worth it to me.

## What if I can't think of anything?

Sometimes you won't have any good ideas worth pursuing but you still want to build something. You can't get better at programming unless you actually practice building challenging programs. Sometimes it's more important to build something than it is to build something you care about. If you just need an idea to run with, so a Google search. There are plenty of project ideas that you can make into reality. They're great for building a portfolio, even if no one else uses them.

## What's Next?

In part 2, I'll discuss the planning phase and cover how to start after you've come up with an idea. If you're excited for this series, have criticism or just want to say hi, please leave a comment below.
