      <div id="bio">
        I'm the type who loves math and science. I took as many of those classes as I could. When I was getting my psychology degree I took some classes in Behavioral Analysis. I loved it because it was like psychology, but based on data and statistics. After a year in the field, I decided that although I could be great in that field, it didn't challenge me the way I wanted to be challenged. I had been learning programming in my spare time for years by then and decided that now was the time to take a big risk and turn my hobby into a career. I'm looking for a place where I can continue to learn, grow, and be challenged.
