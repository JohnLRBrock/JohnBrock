I love books. Ever since I was told I couldn't read something because it was too hard which in hindsight is a sure fire way to get me to do something.

Goodreads has made my lust for reading easire to catalogue. As of writing my to-read shelf contains just south of 600 books. Finding my next novel in that list became untenable so a couple of years back I made a python script to search my library for instock books that were on my list until it reached a page quota (https://github.com/Khanthulhu/Goodreads-Checkout). I decided that this functionality would be more useful on a website.

This guide will go through how to construct a website using Ruby on Rails and Resque to create an app that interfaces with the Goodreads API to fetch random books until you've reached a page quota.

create a new app with
$rails new book-overload --skip-activerecord
$rails g controller static_pages home

in config/routes set your root path with 
$root, to: 'static_pages/home'

create a request model with
$rails g model request --skip-migration

rails g mailer SelectionMailer
use letter opener to preview emails

Using nokogiri and open-uri to make api requests to goodreads

decide that you wanted to use a database all along.
