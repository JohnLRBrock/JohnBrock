    <a href="https://book-overload.herokuapp.com/">Book Overload</a>
  </h1>
  <p class="project-text">I'm addicted to books. I always have one with me and I can't leave a bookstore without making a purchase. My enthusiasm means that my to-read shelf is encumbered. With almost 600 books, I experience choice overload and can't decide what to read next. This app solves that problem by emailing the user a random set of books from their to-read shelf. Users are introduced to books that they were interested in all over again and in more manageable quantities.<br><strong>What I learned</strong> The project taught me how to learn about new technologies and how to apply problem solving skills to novel problems in a practical context.</p>
